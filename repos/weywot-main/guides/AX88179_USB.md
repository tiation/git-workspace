# Make USB to Gigabit adapters based on the ASIX AX88179 chip work!

## The device
These are very popular with USB(-c) hubs that include an ethernet (gigabit) port. 
They are based around the ASIX AX88179 chip.

Examples of such hubs that have been tested by me and suffer from this issue are the following:

* [UGREEN USB C Hub, USB C Hub Multiport Adapter with 4K 60Hz HDMI,100W Power Delivery, RJ45 Ethernet, 2 USB 3.0 5Gbps Data Ports, for MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, XPS, and More](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08HZ1GGH9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [USB C Hub, Dockteck 6 in 1 USB-C Ethernet PD Hub Adapter with 4K 60Hz HDMI, 100W Power Delivery, USB-C Data Port, 1Gbps Ethernet, 2 USB Ports, for MacBook Pro/Air M1, iPad Pro, HP Laptop](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09DXB1F8C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)
* [USB C Hub, Dockteck 7-in-1 USB-C Hub Multiport Adapter with 4K@60Hz HDMI, Ethernet Port, 100W PD, 2 USB 3.0, SD/microSD, for MacBook Pro/Air, iPad Pro/Air/Mini 6, XPS 13 and More](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08SLS9W72/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

You can notice how these are essentially the same hardware under different names, shapes and sizes. They all use the same ASIX chip.

### Not affected

Most USB(-c) to ethernet adapters (no HDMI) use the more common Realtek 8152 or 8153, which work perfectly out of the box. 
This guide is not for those adapters (since they work fine).

For example this thing here, works great (but no HDMI and/or charging, so a different device altogehter).

## The problem
Ethernet disconnects and reconnects all the time with output similar to this:

And the loop restarts.

This clearly makes the adapter completely unusable for ethernet use.

This problem is documented also in this kernel bug (ID 212731):

[USB Ethernet adapter ASIX AX88179 disconnects under heavy load.](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212731)


## The kernels
Althouth it's mentioned that kernels from 5.19 should work fine (and that a fix has been applied), the problem persists.
I have tried all Fedora kernels from 5.18 to 5.19.12 (as of today), and the problem persists.
The problem also persists on Pop!\_OS 22.04 with 5.17 all the way to 5.19 and Ubuntu 22.04 with 5.15 (and backports).

## The solution
To compile and install a different driver.

I have tried this driver provided by **nothingstopsme** here: https://github.com/nothingstopsme/AX88179_178A_Linux_Driver

Clone the repo to your disk, then enter the source folder, and do ```make``` and ```sudo make install``` and reboot. That's it.

## What about the kernel driver
It appears there are two drivers sources, one from the manufacturer, used in the kernel, and one from the community (?), which is the one used by **nothingstopsme** in his github page. Currently the effort is to get the manufacturer based driver to work in the kernel, and while there has been some work (as reported [here](https://github.com/nothingstopsme/AX88179_178A_Linux_Driver/issues/1#issuecomment-1265282661)) the problem stil persists. 

## What happens when I update my kernel?

You need to compile the driver and install it again for each new kernel. Sorry.
