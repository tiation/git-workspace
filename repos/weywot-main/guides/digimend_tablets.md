# How to make a Huion tablet work in Pop!_OS

This is valid for many but not all Huion tablets. The principle behind this is to make the tablet appear to the **wacom** driver. For that we need another driver to make the connection.
This is the [**digimend** driver](https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers). 

This guide is for the Gaomon M106K, which is a rebranded Huion with **USB Device ID** 256c:006e. Many Huion tablets use the same device ID but not all. Other tablets will work in the same way.

## Install digimend driver

On Ubuntu based systems you can install from apt:

```sudo apt install digimend-dkms```

Otherwise, from source.

We need some dependencies: 

```sudo apt install dkms git-core```

and then install from source:

~~~
sudo git clone https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers.git /usr/src/digimend-6
sudo dkms build digimend/6
sudo dkms install digimend/6
~~~

*Note*: Not sure what the *-6* and the */6* point to, as the latest version should be **9**. Will correct later if needed.

Once the driver is installed, a reboot is required, then

```xinput --list``` should display:

~~~
otheos@weywot:~/Git/weywot$ xinput list

    ↳ Logitech MX Master 3                    	id=21	[slave  keyboard (3)]
~~~

The tablet is **id12** and **id13**.

A quick check to see the driver is running with ```dkms status``` should show **digimend** (note: currently in my system it doesn't, but everything works. I will investigate).

## Configure X11

Tablets current only work on X, not on Wayland. So X11 needs to be informed of the input device, to pass it on to the **wacom** kernel.

We add a file in ```/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-digimend.conf``` (the filename is not important but the number *50* is, as in needs to go before the existing wacom file that starts with *70*)

The contents are like this:

~~~

# InputClass sections for some tablets supported by the DIGImend kernel
# drivers. Organized into separate InputClass sections based on (one of) the
# advertised brands. Mostly because the MatchUSBID options would become too
# long otherwise.
#
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Huion tablets with Wacom driver"
        MatchUSBID "5543:006e|256c:006e"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "wacom"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Ugee/XP-Pen tablets with Wacom driver"
        MatchUSBID "28bd:007[145]|28bd:0094|28bd:0042|5543:004[57]|5543:0081|5543:0004|5543:3031"
        # Exclude the original WP5540U which PID is reused by Ugee M540
        NoMatchProduct "MousePen"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "wacom"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Ugtizer tablets with Wacom driver"
        MatchUSBID "2179:0053"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "wacom"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Yiynova tablets with Wacom driver"
        MatchUSBID "5543:004d"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "wacom"
EndSection
~~~

The first entry is the one that supports the Huion tablets. 

Here's another similar file for the Huion Q11 v2:

~~~
# Huion tablets  
Section "InputClass"  
    Identifier "Huion class"  
    MatchProduct "HUION"  
    MatchIsTablet "on"  
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"  
    Driver "wacom"  
EndSection  

Section "InputClass"  
    Identifier "Huion buttons"  
    MatchProduct "HUION"  
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"  
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"  
    Driver "evdev"  
EndSection  

Section "InputClass"  
    Identifier "Huion scroll"  
    MatchProduct "HUION"  
    MatchIsPointer "off"  
    MatchIsKeyboard "off"  
    MatchIsTouchpad "off"  
    MatchIsTablet "off"  
    MatchIsTouchscreen "off"  
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"  
    Driver "evdev"  
EndSection
~~~

*Note*: My understanding of the syntax of these files is not yet great, I will improve and get back to explain the point of all these entries.

At this point a **reboot** will get X to see the input device.

## Configure the Tablet's buttons for use

All configuration is done with the ```xsetwacom``` command. Before the digimend driver was installed, the ```xsetwacom list``` command should come out empty.
Once the driver works, ```xsetwacom list``` should show all detected devices:

In my case: 

~~~
otheos@weywot:~$ xsetwacom list
HID 256c:006e Pen stylus        	id: 12	type: STYLUS    
HID 256c:006e Pad pad           	id: 13	type: PAD       
~~~

Each button needs each own command, so a script with all of them is apporpriate. 

Depending on the software used, the buttons can be mapped to keys and/or shortcuts. 

This is mine for my set of shortcuts for [kami](www.kamiapp.com]

~~~

xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pen stylus" Button 2 "key 1" #pen to down stylus button
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pen stylus" Button 3 "key 2" #erase to up stylus button

xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 1 "key shift" #shift - draw straight
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 2 "key ctrl z" #undo

xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 3 "key 3" #add shape
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 8 "key 6" #hand tool

xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 9 "key 4" #box highlight
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 10 "key 5" #select annotations


xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 11 "key ctrl +" #zoom in
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 12 "key ctrl -" #zoom out

xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 13 "key +up" #up
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 14 "key +pgup" #pgup

xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 15 "key +down" #down
xsetwacom set "HID 256c:006e Pad pad" Button 16 "key +pgdn" #pgdown

#keys on pad
# 1	2
# 3	8
# 9	10
# 11	12
# 13	14
# 15	16
#
~~~

The script can be turned executable with ```chmod +x``` and then (if desired) set to autostart using one of the usual ways, but it needs to start *after* X is up, so ideally from GDM, rather than cron.

Here's another such script with more features configured (this one for the Q11 v2)

Many features can be configured, so check with ```xsetwacom```. 

Also check status with ```xinput list-props 'HID 256c:006e Pad pad'``` ```and xinput list-props 'HID 256c:006e Pen stylus'```

The name between the quotes is that which appears in the output of ```xsetwacom list```.

Plenty of resources, Arch Wiki, as always, great: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wacom_tablet

## Appendix

Some random ```xsetwacom``` commands that are helpful.

~~~
otheos@kepler:~$ xsetwacom list devices
Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Finger touch	id: 11	type: TOUCH     
Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus	id: 12	type: STYLUS    
Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen eraser	id: 18	type: ERASER  
~~~
~~~
otheos@kepler:~$ xsetwacom --shell get "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" all 
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "Area" "0 0 29376 16524"

xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "ZoomDistance" "0"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "ScrollDistance" "0"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "TapTime" "250"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "CursorProximity" "30"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "Rotate" "none"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "Threshold" "26"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "BindToSerial" "0"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "PressureRecalibration" "on"
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "PanScrollThreshold" "1300"
~~~

The ```--shell get``` option renders all commands that can be run from a shell, along with current options.

This is great to store when you start to keep an eye on defaults.

Finally: **Resetting** to stock!

~~~
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "Button" "1" "button +1 "
~~~

Or,

~~~
xsetwacom set "Wacom Pen and multitouch sensor Pen stylus" "Button" "1"
~~~

Effectively without an option, resets to default.
