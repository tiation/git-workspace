# Create a Raspberry Pi 4 kiosk

## Install and configure the Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS

Donwload images from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit)
Currently the 32bit image is the better one.

Use ```dd``` to write the image to a microSD card.

Once the new partitions are mounted, go to ```/boot``` and set the flag for **ssh** with ```touch ssh```.
Then, still in ```/boot```, create the **wpa** file for the wifi:

```nano wpa_supplicant.conf```
~~~
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
country=GB
update_config=1

network={
 ssid="Sol"
 psk="wifipassword"
}
~~~

Boot the Raspberry Pi.

## Basic configuration

Once it boots, connect with **ssh** (you will need to find the IP from your router/dhcp server).
If your network has internal name resolution, you can do ```ssh pi@raspberrypi```

* Username: pi
* Password: raspberry

Once connected run the basic updates with:

```sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y```

You can check/upgrade the firmware with ```sudo rpi-update```

Once this is complete, run ```sudo raspi-config``` and change the following:

* System Options: Password, Hostname, Set Auto Login
* Performance Options: CPU Memory (set to 256MB)
* Advanced Options: Compositor (disable it)

At this point reboot to apply all changes.

You can further configure the Pi by editing its config file ```sudo nano /boot/config.txt```

You can add:
~~~
max_framebuffers=1
~~~
If on a single screen.

and 
~~~
arm_freq=1800
gpu_freq=700
over_voltage=6
~~~

For a mild overclock without any cooling. For 2.0GHz overclock active cooling is required. The GPU can be pushed to 750MHz.

Further configuration for the HDMI output, resolution, overscan can be done in this file too. 
Options can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/)

## Create the kiosk script

All info from [here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-kiosk/)

Needed software:
~~~
sudo apt-get install xdotool unclutter sed
~~~

The ```kiosk.sh``` script looks like this:

~~~
#!/bin/bash
#https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-kiosk/
xset s noblank
xset s off
xset -dpms
unclutter -idle 0.5 -root &
sed -i 's/"exited_cleanly":false/"exited_cleanly":true/' /home/pi/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences
sed -i 's/"exit_type":"Crashed"/"exit_type":"Normal"/' /home/pi/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences

Look for the original guide for explanations.

## Create the service to start up at boot

```sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/kiosk.service```

And add:

~~~
[Unit]
Description=Chromium Kiosk
Wants=graphical.target
After=graphical.target

[Service]
Environment=DISPLAY=:0.0
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/home/pi/.Xauthority
Type=simple
~~~

and enable it with ```sudo systemctl enable kiosk.service```

You can now start it and your kiosk will be running. ```sudo systemctl start kiosk.service```.

## Install rpimonitor

All information from [here](h)/xavierberger.github.io/RPi-Monitor-docs/11_installation.html)

~~~
sudo apt-get install dirmngr
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 2C0D3C0F
sudo wget http://goo.gl/vewCLL -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rpimonitor.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rpimonitor
sudo /etc/init.d/rpimonitor update
~~~

The service is enabled immediately. You can access the web page on ```http://raspberry-ip:8888```

### Configure rpimonitor

You can enable three addons:

* Top 3
* Wifi
* Shellinabox

#### Top 3
In the current version, top 3 addon is enabled from the ```data.conf``` file in ```/etc/rpimonitor```.

Just uncomment:
~~~
web.addons.5.name=Top3
web.addons.5.addons=top3
~~~

then go to ```templates/cpu.conf``` 
and uncomment:
~~~
web.status.1.content.1.line.4=InsertHTML("/addons/top3/top3.html")
~~~

Finally add the cron job that collects the data by doing:

```sudo cp /usr/share/rpimonitor/web/addons/top3/top3.cron /etc/cron.d/top3```

Restart the service with ```sudo systemctl restart rpimonitor```. You're done.


#### WiFi

While the network addon is enabled by default, it only points to the ethernet use.
The wifi addon is enabled again in ```/etc/rpimonitor/data.conf``` by uncommenting:

~~~
include=/etc/rpimonitor/template/wlan.conf
~~~

Restart the service with ```sudo systemctl restart rpimonitor```. You're done.

#### Shellinabox

This will allow you to open a shell from within the website.

First install it:

``` sudo apt install shellinabox```

Now this is a bit old school. You need to start the service with ```sudo /etc/init.d/shellinabox  start```

The configuration file is minimal, most options are in the init script above and some are in ```/etc/default/shellinabox```. 

Nothing needs to be changed, just check it runs in the correct port:

```netstat -ntl``` should give you (among others):
~~~
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4200            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
~~~

Now enable it in rpimonitor, again from ```/etc/rpimonitor/data.conf``` by uncommenting:

~~~
web.addons.1.name=Shellinabox
web.addons.1.addons=shellinabox
~~~

Adding these underneath:

~~~
web.addons.1.url=https://raspberry-ip:4200/
web.addons.1.allowupdate=false
~~~

The above mighht not be necessary, try without first.

Note, **shellinabox** runs on http**s**. You can access it as standalone on ```https://raspberry-ip:4200```

or, once you restart rpiconfig, from the addons dropdown.

### Temperatures and CPU speed script

This is just a sidenote:
This script (```measure.sh```)
~~~
#!/bin/bash
cpur=`vcgencmd measure_clock 48 | cut -d "=" -f 2`
cpu=$(expr $cpur / 1000000)
temp=`vcgencmd measure_temp | cut -d "=" -f 2`


echo $cpu"MHz" $temp
~~~

This will give you CPU speed in MHz and temperature in C.

You can run ```watch -n 1 ./measure.sh``` to get a monitor of sorts.

### Install Webmin

All information from [here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-webmin/)

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions python
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.920_all.deb
sudo dpkg --install webmin_1.920_all.deb
~~~

Access it from here: ```https://raspberry-ip:10000```


### Play local videos with mpv

Local videos are stored in ```/home/pi/Videos```.

We need to fetch them from ```Google Drive```. 

#### Instal rclone

Simple: ```sudo apt install rclone```

Can be configured with information from [here](https://rclone.org/drive/)

Effectively:
```rclone config```

and then:

~~~
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

~~~

With the ```root_folder_id=``` left blank, this is the root of the ```Google Drive```.

If your 
You can browse the remote content in **CSFC** (the name of that account), with:

```rclone lsd CSFC:```

Or look for files with:

```rclone ls CSFC:```

Finally you can copy folders from ```Google Drive``` with:

```rclone copy CSFC:foldername /home/pi/Kiosk/Videos````

Now what you place in the ```Rpi_Videos```, is cloned to ```~/Videos``` for local use.

#### Install MPV

```sudo apt install mpv```

#### Script to clone videos and play them.

Name this ```localvideo.sh``` in your root folder.

~~~
#!/bin/bash
rclone sync CSFC:Rpi_Videos /home/pi/Kiosk/Videos
vids=( `ls /home/pi/Kiosk/Videos` )
for v in "${vids[@]}"
do
echo $v
DISPLAY=:0 mpv /home/pi/Kiosk/Videos/$v -fs --input-media-keys=yes
sleep 20
done
~~~

Create a cron job for it with Webmin to run every 20 minutes (adjust according to expected number of videos and their length.

#### Script to clone Youtube addresses and play them

Note: Requires youtube-dl, not the version that comes with the distro, but a fresh one (using pip).
Remove the old before installing the new.
Also check that the youtube-dl execucable is (or has a link) in ```/usr/bin``` (for cron to work). 

Name this ```youtue.sh```.

~~~
#!/bin/bash
rclone sync CSFC:Rpi_Youtube /home/pi/Kiosk/Youtube
tubes=( `cat /home/pi/Kiosk/Youtube/Youtube` )
#echo ${tubes[0]}
for u in "${tubes[@]}"
do
echo $u
DISPLAY=:0 mpv $u --slang=en --fs --ytdl-raw-options=ignore-config=,sub-lang=en,write-auto-sub=,format='bestvideo[height<=720]+bestaudio'--input-media-keys=yes
sleep 20
done
~~~

It expects a text file named ```Youtube``` in the ```Rpi_Youtube``` folder on ```Google Drive``` with youtube links, on separate lines.

### Show IP address on the screen

All information from [here](https://linuxhint.com/osd_overlay_fullscreen_linux_apps/)

You need this for networks where you don't have a static IP and no control over the DHCP server.

Make a script file ```disp_ip.sh```

~~~
#!/bin/bash
ip addr show  wlan0 | grep "inet " | awk '{print $2}' | DISPLAY=:0 osd_cat --font -*-*-*-*-*-*-28-*-*-*-*-*-*-* --delay 20
ip addr show  wlan0 | grep "inet " | awk '{print $2}' > curr_ip
rclone copy curr_ip  CSFC:PhysicsBoard

~~~

This aslo puts a txt file on Google Drive for the record.

The Cron jobs for some reason won't run unless all binaries are given with full path (i.e ```/usr/sbin/ip```)
