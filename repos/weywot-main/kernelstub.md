# How kernelstub works to pass options to the kernel at boot

Kernel options are passed during boot from the loader entry file, e.g ```/boot/efi/loader/entries/Pop_OS-current.conf```

This file, however **should not** be directly edited as any changes will be overwritten after a kernel update (or other update that calls for a rewrite of the entry file).

Instead all kernel options are passed using the ```kernelstub```. It requires **root** privilege, so you either run it with **sudo** or as root.

The three options you need to know for it are:

* ```kernelstub -a "option"``` inserts the option between the quotes (quotes required).
* ```kernelstbu -d "option"``` removes the option between the quotes (quotes required).
* ```kernelstub -p``` prints the current setup.

Here's mine for example:

~~~
otheos@weywot:~$ sudo kernelstub -p 
kernelstub.Config    : INFO     Looking for configuration...
kernelstub           : INFO     System information:

You can see the line that starts with ```Kernel Boot Options:```

And this is the output of ```cat /boot/efi/loader/entries/Pop_OS-current.conf ```

~~~

You can see they're identical after the ```ro``` point. 

It would appear that either editing the loader file ```Pop_OS-current.conf``` has the same effect, and indeed it does, but only until an upgrade (or other call) runs kernelstub internally, in which case the loader file is overwritten, with whatever kernelstub has stored.

You can verify this, simply by adding a kernel option to the loader file, and then using ```kernelstub -p``` to verify it's not there. 

When ```kernelstub``` is run, it interfaces with its configuration file in ```/etc/kernelstub/configuration```. 

All the options you pass with ```kernelstub -a``` are stored under the *user* section.

For example, my ```/etc/kernelstub/configuration``` is like so:

~~~
{
  "default": {
    "kernel_options": [
      "quiet",
      "splash"
    ],
    "esp_path": "/boot/efi",
    "setup_loader": false,
    "manage_mode": false,
    "force_update": false,
    "live_mode": false,
    "config_rev": 3
  },
  "user": {
    "kernel_options": [
      "splash",
      "mitigations=off",
      "resume=UUID=f18aecac-b409-4946-8b59-4d7210f60060",
      "loglevel=0",
      "resume_offset=31633408",
      "mem_sleep_default=deep"
    ],
    "esp_path": "/boot/efi",
    "setup_loader": true,
    "manage_mode": true,
    "force_update": false,
    "live_mode": false,
    "config_rev": 3
  }
~~~

You can see in the *user* section all the options I have passed and have appeared in the output of the ```kernelstub -p``` command.

So, three different places for kernel options? No! Just one: the configuration file. You write to it using the ```kernelstub``` command, either with ```-a``` to add to the user section, or ```-d``` to remove an option from the user section. Or, if you wish, you can edit the file directly.

Once kernelstub knows what options you want your kernels to **always** have, it creates the loader file with these options.

If you instead edit the loader file, it's the same as adding those options at boot by editing (with ```e```) the boot options. This means ```kernelstub``` doesn't know them, and when it rewrites the loader (when required after e.g an update), all your options are gone.
