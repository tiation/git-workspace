findimagedupes * | awk '{print $2}' | xargs exiftool | grep -w 'File\ Name\|Image\ Width\|Image\ Height\|File\ Size' 

also | args rm (deletes them)

also look at this for spaces in names

findimagedupes * | cut -f 7-18 -d "/" | sed 's/^/\//' | sed  's/\ /\\\ /g' | \ls -l

cut cuts with / and sorts for some / after,

first sed puts back the leading /
second sed replaces all space with \space (recuring, g at the end)
